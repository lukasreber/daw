Update 06/08/2018 - Well it finally happened, Melbourne housing has cooled off. So here's your challenge; 1) when did it exactly happen? , 2) Could you see it slowing down? What were the variables that showed the slowing down (was it overall price, amount sold vs unsold, change in more rentals sold and less housing, changes in which CouncilArea or Region, more houses sold in distances further away from Melbourne CBD and less closer)? 3) Could you have predicted it (I'm not sure how you would do this, but I'm sure you magicians have a way that would make me think we should burn you for being a witch) 4) Should I hold off even longer in buying a two bedroom apartment in Northcote? <-- This is the real reason for me in publishing this dataset :)
Update 22/05/2018 - Will continue with a smaller subset of the data (not as many columns). The web scraping was taking some time and also may potentially cause problems. Will continue to post the data.
Update 28/11/2017 - Last few weeks clearance levels starting to decrease (I may just be seeing a pattern I want to see.. maybe I'm just evil). Anyway, can any of you magicians make any sense of it?

Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where's the expensive side of town? And more importantly where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit?
